Interactive New Year's Fortune Gacha

**Objective:**

Create a compact and interactive New Year's gacha machine using Arduino, Adafruit Trellis, Matter.js, p5.js, a toggle switch, LED, and physical gacha balls.

**Who:**
Yuri, Hyeona, Minji, Chaeri

**Week 1: Setup and Integration**

- Project research and materials research: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trellis-diy-open-source-led-keypad
- Set up the development environment for Arduino, p5.js and Matter.js.
- Connect Adafruit Trellis, toggle switch, and LED to Arduino.
- Develop basic code to control LED with toggle switch.
- Implement p5.js and Matter.js for gacha ball simulation on the screen.

**Week 2: Simulation and Interaction**

- Construct a simple cardboard gacha box for physical interaction with laser cutting machine/ 
- Integrate Adafruit Trellis for user input.
- *Maybe* Integrate a sound during gacha ball animation. 
- Combine all elements to display a personalized New Year's fortune.

**Challenges:**

- Software integration with p5.js and Matter.js
- Software & hardware integration with animation and Trellis in arduino circuit. 
- Smooth coordination of the exerpience.

**Assistance Needed:**

- Troubleshooting hardware integration.
- Any software bugs.
- Verifying user input recognition.

We want to deliver a fun and interactive New Year's experience, with a theme around New Years and surprise.
